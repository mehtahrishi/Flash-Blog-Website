<h3>Facts About the Flash</h3>
<p>
    The Flash is a fictional superhero from the The <i><u><strong> DC Comics </strong></u></i> with super cool speed.
    The Flash is known as the <u>Fastest Man Alive as a Speedster </u>in  this series .
    There are many Speedsters shown in this series. <b>The Flash</b> is an 
    American superhero television series developed by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg,
 and Geoff Johns, airing on <mark>The CW.</mark> It is based on the Barry Allen incarnation of<i><u><strong> DC Comics </strong>
 </u></i>character the Flash,
 a costumed superhero crime-fighter with the power to move at superhuman speeds. It is a spin-off of <b>Arrow</b>, existing in the same
 fictional universe known as the<b> Arrowverse.</b> The series follows Barry Allen, portrayed by Grant Gustin,
 a crime scene investigator who gains super-human speed, which he uses to fight criminals, including others who have also
 gained superhuman abilities.</p>
<p> Initially envisioned as a backdoor pilot, the positive reception Gustin received during
 two appearances as Barry on Arrow led to executives choosing to develop a full pilot to make use of a
 larger budget and help flesh out Barry's world in more detail. The series is primarily filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</p>
<p> Flash premiered in North America on October 7, 2014, where the pilot became the second-most watched premiere in the history
 of The CW, after The Vampire Diaries in 2009. It has been well received by critics and audiences, and won the People's Choice Award for
 "Favorite New TV Drama" in 2014. The series, together with Arrow, has spun characters out to their own show, Legends of Tomorrow, 
 which premiered on January 21, 2016. In March 2022, the series was renewed for a ninth season which premiered on February 8, 2023, 
 and will serve as the series' final season.

<h3>Series Overview About The Flash</h3>
<p>  The first season follows crime-scene investigator Barry Allen who gains super-human speed after the explosion of the S.T.A.R. Labs'
     particle accelerator which he uses to fight crime and hunt other metahumans in Central City as the Flash, a masked superhero.
     Barry eventually discovers that his mentor Harrison Wells is actually Eobard Thawne, his archenemy from the future who murdered his
     mother Nora Allen when he was a child. By the end of the season, Eobard's ancestor Eddie sacrifices himself to erase Eobard from
     existence only to open a singularity in the process.
</p>
<p>In the second season, the singularity brings speedster Zoom from a parallel universe of Earth-2, who seeks to eliminate
   all other speedsters in the multiverse where Barry meets his father Henry Allen's Earth-3 counterpart Jay Garrick. 
   After Zoom kills Barry's father, Barry defeats Zoom and travels back in time to save his mother's life.
</p>
<p>In the third season, Barry creates the alternate timeline "Flashpoint" following his decision to change his past. 
    He is somewhat able to restore the timeline, but causes the emergence of Savitar, a god-like speedster with a grudge against Barry.
     When Barry accidentally travels to the future and sees Iris West killed by Savitar, he becomes desperate to change the future
      to prevent that from happening. After saving Iris and defeating Savitar, Barry takes his place in the Speed Force in order to 
      repent for his creation of Flashpoint.
</p>
<p>The fourth season sees Team Flash successfully bring Barry back from the Speed Force, but in the process release dark matter
     that turns a dozen people on a city bus into metahumans, masterminded by Clifford DeVoe, an adversary with the fastest mind alive.
      After the defeat of DeVoe, the team is approached by Barry and Iris' daughter from the future Nora West-Allen.

</p>
<p>During the fifth season, the team discover that Nora's presence has altered the timeline and unleashed Cicada, a serial killer
     bent on killing metahumans, as well as the aftermath of thwarting Thinker's plot causing ordinary items to be imbued with dark
      matter that turns them into Meta-Tech. They also eventually learn of her allegiance with an imprisoned Eobard, who orchestrated
      Nora's arrival and previously trained her when it came to her fight with Godspeed. Barry and Nora succeed in subduing an escaped 
      Eobard, but are forced to let him go and Nora is erased from the timeline.

</p>
<p>In the sixth season, Barry and Iris learn that the date of the crisis in which Barry disappears has moved up to December 2019,
     and that in order to save billions, the Flash must die. Meanwhile, Ramsey Rosso has discovered a way to cure people through 
     dark matter, only to turn himself into a metahuman with a violent bloodthirst. Following Rosso's defeat, Barry surviving Crisis,
      and the multiverse's destruction and rebirth, Team Flash try to navigate the world post-Crisis all while the secret organization
       Black Hole and quantum engineer Eva McCulloch, who is trapped in a dimension called the Mirror Dimension, move forward with their
        mysterious plans. Eva captures Iris and Kamila and later Captain Singh and imprisons them in her Mirror Dimension using their mirror
         versions to fight Team Flash.

</p>
<p>In the seventh season, Team Flash continues their fight against Eva as they successfully create a new Speed Force while Iris 
    continues to search for a way out of the Mirror Dimension. As a side effect of Eva's attacks, Caitlin and Frost are separated 
    into different bodies. Afterwards, Team Flash must contend with the other forces created from the Speed Force's rebirth like the 
    Strength Force, the Sage Force, and the Still Force. Fuerza becomes the avatar of the Strength force, Psych becomes the avatar of 
    the Sage Force, and Deon Owen becomes the avatar of the Still Force. Afterwards, Team Flash gets caught up in a war between the
     different Godspeed drones who are looking for August Heart. Barry is reunited with his future daughter Nora and meets his future
      son Bart Allen. With the Speed Force tapping into the Negative Speed Force, Thawne is restored to help fight Godspeed when he 
      regains his memory. While Godspeed is defeated, Thawne gets away vowing to become faster than Barry.
</p>
<p>The eighth season starts with the five-part event "Armageddon", where Barry is targeted by Despero, who claims 
    that Barry was running at a speed that destroys the Earth from Despero's point in the future. As Barry persuades Despero to give him 
    seven days to prove him wrong, he starts to suffer from memory issues where he can't remember causing havoc in Central City or Joe West
     somehow dying six months ago, later revealed to be due to Thawne creating a "Reverse-Flashpoint", where he was Flash and Barry was
      Reverse-Flash. With help from the Damien Darhk of the Reverse-Flashpoint timeline, Barry is able to restore the timeline and prevent
       Joe's death. After Barry undid Reverse-Flashpoint, Thawne and Dahrk were revealed to still be alive, but fading away. 
       Thawne asks Barry to save him or else he'd be erased from the timeline; Barry ultimately decides to save him by removing his speed 
       and connection to the Negative Speed Force while also repelling Despero. After this, Team Flash deals with the birth of Deathstorm,
        whose eventual defeat comes at the cost of Frost's life. Barry also encounters Meena Dhawan, who has also gained super-speed with
         help from a revived time remnant of Thawne. They then deal with an infection to the Still Force caused by negative tachyons as it 
         kills the imprisoned Thawne. This infection also created the negative versions of the Strength Force, the Sage Force, and the Still
          Force. The Negative Forces use Iris to revive Thawne in his time remnant's body, but are then defeated, with Thawne being removed 
          from the timeline entirely.
